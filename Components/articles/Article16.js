        NHS / DHSS refunds. You must be aware that your chances of getting a
        refund from the NHS to compensate you for their inability to treat you
        are extremely small. This is because the scheme for refunds is both
        extremely slow and highly restrictive. The “S2 route” covers state
        hospitals only, which we generally advise against for quality and
        reservation reasons. We recommend only private clinics or university
        hospitals. Logically, private provision would not exist unless it was
        better than state services. Therefore you must allow for significant
        expense which you may not recover.
